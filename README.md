> Note: I just made this for fun. If you are planning to use for your app I highly recommend you to use GurbaniNow RESTful API located at [api.gurbaninow.com](https://api.gurbaninow.com) instead of this because this is DEVELOPED FOR EXPLORATION PURPOSES ONLY.

## About
An Apollo Server based GraphQL running as Azure Function powered by the open-source [Shabad OS Database](https://github.com/ShabadOS/database), which provides one the most accurate and correct Gurbani databases available.
